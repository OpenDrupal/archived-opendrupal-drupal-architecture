# Editor friendly: Strategies
- Consider the editor: Most frequent user of the site, provide tools for easy maintenance.
- Avoid access to complex and risk full pages (Block placement, Views, Permissions)
- Reduce the visual noise: tailor admin views, make menu for major admin tasks, avoid needless words.

# Editor friendly: Strategies
- Use Views to create customised overview pages.
- Does the front page have unique content, consider a content type for the front page.
- Consider a separate content type for nodes that should not be deleted by the editor, e.d. landing page. Do not grant create and delete permission for this type.
