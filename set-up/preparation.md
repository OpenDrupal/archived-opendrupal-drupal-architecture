# Preparation

This course is designed to be used as a dialog with a Drupal team of Drupal developers. The customer will provide a project on which this course will focus. Some criteria for the provided project:

- Design or wire frames are available.
- The team is familiar with the design and the scope of the project.
- The project has medium size and complexity.
  - Examples of low complexity: Personal blog site, brochure ware site.
  - Examples of high complexity: Webshop, multilingual site, multi domain site

When the provided project has not yet been started, or was just started (max 2 weeks), the project will benefit from
this course too. But when the project has already progressed, there is a risk that new insights will lead to
refactoring of already build sections, or inconsistent architecture.
